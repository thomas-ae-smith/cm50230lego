\section{Introduction}

% The Introduction should give a brief description of what you have
% done, and also give some idea about why you have done it (motivation).
% I expect you to cite a paper or two for the research context.  For
% coursework~1, one of the papers you should probably cite is
% \citet{BrooksAIJ91}, since you have been asked to take a fairly
% reactive approach to developing robot intelligence.

Built a mindstorms robot, implemented basic subsumption article as discussed in \citet{BrooksAIJ91} and discussed in more detail in \citet{brooks1986robust}.

\section{Approach}

% The approach describes in detail exactly what you have done.  This
% section is longer, and should ideally include some experiments you set
% up, for example to determine in what conditions you could get better
% results from the robot.  The approach should be in sufficient detail
% that another person could replicate your experiments.  You may cite
% other papers here too if you are taking an approach from another
% paper, or modifying it only slightly.

A small range of values for $R$ were tested for the circumnavigation of a typical kitchen. The robot was placed in the same position and orientation for each of five repetitions of each of three values of $R$ --- 60cm, 80cm and 100cm. The timer started at the same time as the robot, and was stopped once the robot had circumnavigated the area and detected an obstacle beyond its starting point. Each condition was repeated until five successful datapoints were collected - causes for unsuccseeful attempts are descripbed in Appendix \ref{app:fail}.
Sources of variation in running times within values of $R$ include the unreliablilty of the ultrasonic sensor when approaching objects at low angles of incidence or teatowels, non-deterministic outcomes if a collision occurs while the robot is moving backwards, and potential non-deterministic outcomes from bumper collisions due to wheel slippage or friction. In order to help discount the decrease in battery charge over the course of the experiment as a potential bias factor, the first experimental condition was repeated once after the other experiments had been performed, and the time obtained was within one standard deviation of the original mean.

I worked alone on this project, using one of the commercial NXT kits rather than the educational kit - supplemented with a set of wheels from my own supply that matched the ones provided with the educational kit.
% Please do mention who shared your robot in the approach section, and
% the extent to which you worked together.  The objective here is to
% learn.  How much you work together is totally up to you so long as you
% each write your report independently.

\section{Results}

% The results section describes the outcomes.  This should be purely
% factual descriptions, including qualitative outcomes, quantitative
% outcomes and possibly statistics.  For example, you could report the
% average speed around a circuit in two conditions plus standard
% deviations and a significance test to tell whether you have evidence
% that the conditions lead to different results. {\em For coursework~1, this
% must include video.}  Typically, the results section can be
% surprisingly short, since the Approach section is the one giving
% details, this is purely and only factual outcomes.

\section{Discussion}

% The discussion is the most discursive part of your paper, it {\em may}
% include speculation. You should discuss the extent to which your
% results addressed the questions described in your introduction, and
% what the results imply about your own work and work more broadly.  You
% might suggest other experimental protocols that could have given
% different results and lessons learned.  This can be a longer section
% as well.

\section{Conclusion}
% The conclusion is just one paragraph.  After possible digressions in
% the discussion, you should come back to state exactly what you tried
% to do (brief summary of the introduction), what the outcome was (brief
% summary of the results), and what you can certainly state as a
% result of this (the implications of the results in light of the introduction.)

\Appendix
\section{Raw Data}\label{app:data}

\section{Unsuccessful attempts}\label{app:fail}
Experimental attempts fell into four categories:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [Successful:] The robot successfully circumnavigated the area and detected a feature beyond its original starting point. A datapoint was recorded with the number of seconds it took to do so.
	\item [Crash:] The provided ultrasonic sensor API functions are not thread safe. Due to the use of both motor and sensor listeners, occasionally one detection is still being processed when another arrives, resulting in a ConcurrentModificationException.
	\item [Fail:] Two main failure modes were observed during the course of experimentation. The robot has a small blind spot directly ahead of it, that the side bumpers do not cover. If an object sufficiently thin or angled to evade ultrasonic detection (such as a metal chair leg or corner of a unit) enters this blind spot, the robot may become stuck against it. Alternatively, due to the triangular wheelbase it is possible in some circumstances for the robot to tip up and become stuck on two wheels or collapse.
	\item [Stall:] As the robot has no rearward-facing sensors, it is possible for it to collide with an object while moving backwards to avoid another collision. In most cases this is not a significant problem, though it can non-determinisitcally change the robot's orientation. In some cases it is possible for the power of the motors to drive the rear wheel up the object sufficiently for the ultrasonic sensor to detect the floor as a false positive, and attempt to back away from it. This leads to a stall in the motors.
